# Excel Homework: Charting Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding data Summary

1.	From the data, it reflects that the entertainment (film/video/music/theatre) industry has more absolute successful outcomes than the other categories.

2.	Over the months’ timeframe for all years compiled, all three outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) counts stay consistent in the order of highest being successful followed by failed and then canceled. 

3.	Throughout all the years, the variation in successful outcomes is most followed by failed outcomes and then least variation is observed in the canceled outcomes.

4.	From the “additional plots needed” chart it’s clear that for any given category the ratio of the defined goal vs pledged stays consistent.

5.	From the “additional plots needed2” chart it’s clear that most average donation is funded for the theatre/play category/subcategory across all years.

6.	From the “additional plots needed3” pie chart it’s clear that the major portion of the projects provided for analysis fall under the category of theatre, so this data set is a limitation in a way because it doesn’t have fair contribution of the number of projects from all categories. 

7.	In this data set, median better summarizes the data as there is lot of variance/skewness in the data set. There is more variability with the successful campaigns, this aligns with the fact that more number of backers funded the projects more is the possibility of success rate as shown in "additional plot needed" tab.
